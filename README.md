# Flutter LazyLoading with BLoC Pattern

This is a very basic example of implementation of pagination with Flutter Blocs design pattern. Breaking a large set of list  data in smaller chunks so that it will improve performance of rendering UI.

- Initially load 10 items 
- Add 10 more items everytime when scrolling position reach to bottom of the listview.

## Use Case
This can be replaced with the real api call.

## Designed Using

- [Flutter BLoC](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_bloc)
